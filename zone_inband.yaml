# NOTE: Type enumerator for Nodes
#   0 : switches
#   1 : end nodes (hosts)
# NOTE: The 'ip' field has different semantics up to the node type.
#       IP of swiches will be used for remote switch management, while
#       IP of end nodes will be used for flow rule generation (ip routing).

# NOTE: As each link is bi-directional, each link descriptor will generate a pair of link objects.
#       The generated link object with opposite direction will have the "_b" suffix in the name.
#       e.g., name: l0 --> name: l0_b 
# NOTE: Type enumerator for Links
#   0 : physical links
